This is the repository for my personal blog. It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate a static site when markdown posts are committed to main.

The repo/blog uses the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/)  theme ([showcase site](https://chirpy.cotes.page/)), bootstrapped from [chirpy-starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) with some of my own modifications.

See the [chirpy-starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) repo for more information and usage.
